in other parts of the state ; the people manufacture
earthenware, pot and pearl ashes, in large quanti-
ties, which they export to New York or Quebec.
Their wool is excellent ; their beef and pork se-
cond to none ; and the price of stall-fed beef in
Montreal, 60 miles from Plattsburg, is such as to
encourage the farmers to drive their cattle to that
market. Their forests supply them with sugar
and molasses, and the soil is well adapted to the
culture of hemp. The land-carriage from any
part of the country, in transporting their produce
to New York, does not exceed 18 miles ; the car-
rying place at Ticonderoga is one mile and a half,
and from fort George, at the s. end of the lake
of that name, to fort Edward, is but 14 miles.
The small obstructions after that are to be removed
by the proprietors of the n. canal. From this
country to Quebec, are annually sent large rafts ;
the rapids at St. John’s and Chamblee being the
only interruptions in the navigation, and those not
so great, but that at some seasons batteaux with
60 bushels of salt can ascend them ; salt is sold
here at half a dollar a bushel. Seranac, Sable, and
Boquet rivers water Clinton county ; the first is
remarkable for the quantity of salmon it pro-
duces.]
