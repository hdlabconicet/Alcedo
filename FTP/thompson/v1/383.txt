in [[Nueva España]]], is of a mild temperature ; si-
tuate in a pleasant and fertile plain, and one which
abounds in maize, wheat, and other seeds. It con-
tains S68 families of Indians, 13 of Spaniards, and
a convent of the religious order of St. Francis;
is one league n. of its capital,

==[[Chiautla]]==, with the addition of Ea Sal, an-
other settlement, the capital of its jurisdiction, in
the same kingdom, thus called from the salt mines
found in it formerly, and from which the inhabi-
tants used to derive a great commerce. At pre-
sent it is in a thorough state of decay, not only as
its trade has fallen off in the other provinces ; but
as the Indians have applied themselves rather to
the cultivation of the soil and the planting of fruits
and pulse, from the traffic of which they derive
their maintenance. It is inhabited by 650 families
of Mexican Indians, and 40 of Spaniards, J\/us~
iees, and Mulattoes. It contains a convent of the
religious order of St. Augustin. The jurisdiction
is so much reduced that it is not more than five
leagues in length and three in width, void of com-
merce, and has but a small revenue. Its inhabi-
tants, although they are somewhat given to the
breeding of small cattle, yet this must hardly be
considered with them a branch of commerce,
since they have scarcely enough of these where-
with to support theiiiselves. It contains only two
other settlements, and these are,

==[[Xicotlan]]==, Huehetlan.
