an hermitage dedicated to St. Denis the Areopa-
gite. It lies to the s. of the city of Barquisimeto,
Between that of Tucuyo and the lake of Maracaibo.
[Carora is 30 leagues to the s. of Coro. Its situa-
tion owes nothing to nature but a salubrious air.
Its soil, dry and covered with thorny plants, gives
no other productions but such as owe almost en-
tirely their existence to the principle of heat. They
remark there a sort of cochineal silvestre as fine as
the misleca, which they suffer to perish. The
land is covered with prolific animals, such as
oxen, mules, horses, sheep, goats, &c. ; and the
activity evinced by the inhabitants to make these
advantageous to them, supports the opinion that
there are but few cities in the Spanish West In-
dies where there is so much industry as at Carora.
The principal inhabitants live by the produce of
their flocks, whilst the rest gain their livelihood
by tanning and selling the hides and skins. Al-
though their tanning be bad, the consumer cannot
reproach the manufacturer, for it is impossible to
conceive how they can sell the article, whatever
may be its quality, at the moderate price it fetches.
The skins and leather prepared at Carora are used
in a great degree by the inhabitants themselves
for boots, shoes, saddles, bridles, and strops.
The surplus of the consumption of the place is
used throughout the province, or is sent to Ma-
racaibo, Cartagena, and Cuba. They also manu-
facture at Carora, from a sort of aloe disthica, very
excellent hammocs, which form another article of
their trade. These employments occupy and
support a population of 6200 souls, who, with a
sterile soil, have been able to acquire that ease and
competency which it appears to have been the
intention of nature to deny them. The city is well
built ; the streets are wide, running in straight
parallel lines. The police and the administration
of justice are in the hands of a lieutenant of the go-
vernor and a cabildo. There is no military au-
thority. Carora lies in lat. 9° 50' n. and is 15
leagues e. of the lake of Maracaibo, 12 n. of
Tocuyo, IS n. w. of Barquisimeto, and 90 w. of
Caracas.]
