[lifornia is one of the most beautiful animals of
Spanish America. It probably differs from the
Toewakish of M. Hearne, or (he elk of the United
States, of which naturalists have very improperly
made the two species of cervus Canadensis and
cervus Strongyloceros. The horns of these stags are
said to be nine feet long, and the animal, when
running, throws up its head to rest them on its
back.

vance towards the w. towards the shores of the
great ocean, which, opposite to China, abounds
with beautiful furs of sea otters.
