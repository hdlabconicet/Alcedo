==[[Chocope|CHOCOPE]]==, San Pedro y San Pablo de,
a small settlement of the province and corregi-
miento of Truxillo in [[Peru]] ; situate in the valley
of Chicama, watered and fertilized by the river of
this name. It produces in abundance grapes,
sugar-canes, olives, and every kind of European
fruit of the most excellent flavour. It was formerly
a large population, since that the few inhabitants
who had been lel't at Concepcion, and those of
Licapa in the same valley, have incorporated
themselves here. It has a very large and handsome
church, although this underwent some damage
from an earthquake experienced in this province
in 1759; the settlement suffered much also in 17S6,
as did all the other towns of the coast, as, very
contrary to the custom of the climate here, it rained
without cessation for a period of 40 days, from
five o’clock in the evening to the same hour in the
following morning, so that the houses were almost
all entirely destroyed. Itis 10 leagues from the capi-
tal, in the royal road which leads to Lima, and
which is called De Valles. Lat. 7° 52' s.

==[[Cholco Cocha|CHOLCO-COCHA]]==, a great lake of the pro-
vince and corregimiento of [[Castro]] Vireyna in [[Peru]],
upon the heights of the mountains of the Andes.
It is navigated by rafts made by the Indians;
fish it has none, from the excesisve cold of its
waters ; from it springs the river Caica-mayu.
Mr. De la Martiniere confounds this lake, which
is called Chocolo-cocha, with the city of Castro
Vireyna, maintaining that the Indians call it by
the latter name, but which is erroneous.

handsome convent of the strict observers of St.
Francis, which is also a college for studies.

==[[Cholula|CHOLULA]]==, a district and jurisdiction of an
alcaldia mayor in [[Nueva España]]]. Its extent is
very limited, being only three leagues in length at
the widest part ; but it is nevertheless well filled with
inhabitants ; its territory is level, and very fertile
in wheat, maize, and pepper, which is here called
chile^ as also in other seeds, of which abundant crops
are gathered ; it formerly acquired agreat emolument
from the sale of cochineal, but this is laid aside
and entirely abandoned. The Spaniards, Mustees^
and Mulattoes, busy themselves in making cloths
and woven stuffs of cotton, and they have many
workshops, by which they supply with these articles
the other provinces. Its population consists of 43
settlements of Indians, which are,
