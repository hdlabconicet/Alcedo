alcaldia mayor of [[Chiapa]], in the kingdom of
Guatemala. Lat. 16'’5S' n. Long. 93° 52' a', [tt
is situate on the Tobasco river, near the city of
Chiapa, and not far from a bay in the S. sea,
called Teguantipac.]

==[[Acapazingo|ACAPAZINGO]]==, San Diego DE,the head set-
tlement of the district and alcaldia mayor of [[Cuer]]-
navaca.

==[[Acapetlamuaia|ACAPETLAMUAIA]]==, a settlement of the head
settlement of the district of [[Escateopan]], and
dia mayor of [[Zaqualpa]]. It contains 180 Indian
families.

==[[Acaponeta|ACAPONETA]]==, the alcaldia mayor of the
kingdom of [[Galicia]], and bishopric of Guadalaxa-
ra, in Nueva Espaua. Its jurisdiction is reduced.
It enjoys various hot and cold temperatures, and
has therefore the crops peculiar to both climates;
and the same are sown in its district, and produce
abundantly. The capital is the town of the same
name, situate between the two rivers St. Pedro
and de Caiias ; the latter dividing [[Nueva España]]]
from the provinces of Rosario and Cinaloa, as also
the bishoprics of Durango and Gaudalaxara, from
Avhence it is distant 83 leagues, w. n. w. It has a
convent of the order of St. Francisco. Long. 103°
40' SO". Lat. 22° 43' 30".

==[[Acapulco|ACAPULCO]]==, or Los Reyes, the capital city of
the government of [[Nueva España]], situate on the
coast of the S. sea. Its inhabitants amount to nearly
400 families of Chinese, Mulatfoes, and Negroes.
It has a parish church, with two vicars, and two
convents, one of the order of St. Francis, and the
other of St. Hyppolite de la Casidad, which is a
royal hospital ; an office of public accounts, with
an accountant and treasurer for the managing and
keeping the accounts of the duties produced by the
goods brought in the China ships. The city is
small, and the churches and houses are moderately
ornamented. The greater part of the city is on
the sea-shore. 'Fhe air is of an extremely hot and
moist temperature ; for, independent of its being
in the torrid zone, it is entirely shut out from the
r&gt;. winds, being surrounded by lofty serranias.
These circumstances render it very unhealthy,
especially in the wet season, on account of the
damps and sea-winds blowing from the s. e. to
the great detriment of the inhabitants and mer-
chants who come to trade here ; this being the
principal cause why there are scarcely more than
eight Spanish families who reside here. It is
equally in want of every sort of provision, owing
to the reduced and barren state of the land, and is
forced to seek its necessary supplies from the In-
dian settlements within its jurisdiction. The only
commerce which it canbe said to have, is a fair which

is held on the arrival of the ships from China ; and
when these depart, there are no other means for
the people of maintaining a trade, and if the above
resource should happen to fail for three or four
years, the place must inevitably be abandoned.
At the distance of a musket-shot, and on a pro-
montory running far into the sea, is situate the
castle and royal fort of San Diego, mounted with
31 pieces of artillery, the greater part of them
24 pounders, for the defence of the entrance of the
port, which is safe, and so spacious, that 500
ships can lay at anchor in it with ease. It is sur-
rounded by lofty rising grounds. Its principal
mouth is on the s. side, formed by an island of an
oblong figure, and somewhat inclining to the s. w.
The same island forms also another mouth, which
they call chica, or little. The canals on either
side of the island are 25 fathoms deep. The go-
vernor of the castle has the rank of Castellano ^ with
the title of lieutenant-general of the coasts of the
S. Sea ; and for the defence of these coasts, there
are three companies of militia, composed of the
the whole of the inhabitants, namely, one company
of Chinese, another of Mulattoes, and the third of
Negroes, who run to arms whenever they hear
the cannon fired three times at short intervals.
In the settlements of its neighbourhood they grow
cotton, maize, and other seeds, vegetables and
fruits. They have cattle of the large and small
kind, and some tobacco, all of which productions
are sufficient for the use of the castle and the city,
which is 80 leagues distant from Mexico. — [The
famous cut in the mountain, {ahra de San Nicholas)^
near the bay de la Langosta, for the admission of
the sea winds, was recently finished. The popu-
lation of this miserable town, inhabited almost ex-
clusively by people of colour, amounts to 9000
at the time of the arrival of the Manilla galleon
(nao de China). Its habitual population is only
4000. The chief trade of Acapulco continues still
to be its commerce with Manilla. 'Fhe Manilla
ship arrives once a year at Acapulco, with a cargo
of Indian goods, valued at 12 or 1300,000 dollars,
and carries back silver in exchange, with a very
small quantity of American produce, and some
European goods. Lat. according to Humboldt,
16° 50' 29'. Long, by ditto, 99° 46'. Lat. accord-
ing to the Spaniards, 16° 50' 30". Long, by ditto,
100°. Both longitudes being measured from the
meridian of Greenwich.]

==[[Acaraga|ACARAGA]]==, a river of the province and govern-
ment of Paraguay. It rises in the province of the
Parana, and runnings, enters the Uruguay, where
is the city of Asuncion. It is navigable by ca-
noes throughout, and abounds in fish.
