==[[Bravo|BRAVO]]==, a large and abundant river of the
kingdom of [[Nueva España]], which rises in 40"^
80' n. lat. and runs s. till it enters the sea in
the bay of Mexico, in 25'^ 55'. [Under the 40°
of latitude, the sources of the Rio del Norte, or
Rio Bravo, are only separated from the sources of
the Rio Colorado by a mountainous tract of from
12 to 13 leagues of breadth. This tract is the
continuation of the cordillera of the Cranes, which
stretches towards the s?erra Verde and the lake of
Timpanogos, celebrated in the Mexican history.
The Rio S. Rafael and the Rio S. Xavier are the
principal sources of the river Zaguananas, which,
with the Rio de Nabajoa, forms the Rio Colorado :
the latter has its embouchure in the gulf of Cali-
fornia. These regions, abounding in rock-salt,
were examined in 1777 by two travellers full of
zeal and intrepidity, monks of the order of St.
Francis, Father Escalante and Father Antonio
Velez. Rut however interesting the Rio Zagua-
nanas and the Rio del Norte may one day become
for the internal commerce of this n. part of New
Spain, and however easy the carriage may be
across the mountains, no communication will ever,
it is Jhought, result from it, comparable to that
opened directly from sea to sea.

==[[Bravo]]==, anotlier river in the province and go-
vernment of Maracaibo. It is one of the arms of
the Catacumbo, which enters in a large body into
the great lake,

==[[[[Brasil|Brazil]]|BRAZIL]]==, a kingdom of S. America, situate in
the torrid zone, extending from the mouth of the
large river Maranon, or Amazonas, to that of La
Plata, from 2° n. to 35° s. of the equinoctial line.
It is of a triangular figure, two of its sides, the n.
and e. bqing bounded by the sea, and the third,
which is the greater, isthe line of demarcation be-
tween this kingdom, which belongs to the crown of
Portugal, and the dominions of the king of Spain.
This country was discovered by Vincente Yanez
Pinzon in 1198; aftcrw'ardsby DiegoLoj)czinI500;

by Americo Vespucio in 1501 ; and by Pedro Al-
varez Cabral in 1502, who was by chance sailing
for the E. Indies. He gave it the name of Santa
Cruz, in memory of the day on which it was dis-
covered ; this, however, it did not retain, and it
has been called continually [[Brasil|Brazil]], from the
abundance of fine wood of this name found in it-
On the death of the king Don Sebastian, this king-
dom, as forming a part of the dominion of Portu-
gal, came to Philip III. by inheritance, as belong-
ing to the crown of Castille. The Dutch, under
the command of the prince of Nassau, made them-
selves masters of the greater part of it; but this
loss was again recovered by the Spanish and Por-
tuguese, after a bloody Avar of many years dura-
tion, when it was restored to the dominion of the
latter by a treaty of general peace. It is divided
into 14 provinces or captainships ^ which are, Rio
Janeiro, Todos Santos, Ilheos, Parayba, Para,
Maranan, Espiritu Santo, Itamaraca, Seara,
Puerto Seguro, Pernambuco, Sergipe del Rey,
San Vincente, and Rio Grande ; and in these are
12 cities, 67 towns, and an infinite number of
small settlements and villages, divided into four
bishoprics, suffragan to an archbishop ; and be-
sides these there is the district of [[San]] Pablo de los
Mamelucos, which is governed after the manner
of a republic, with some subordination to the
crown of Portugal. Also there are the districts of
Dele atid Petaguey, which being in the centre of
the captainship of [[Seara]], belong to the barbarians,
and to some Portuguese who are independent of
the jurisdiction of Rey. The French, in 1584,
established themselves in Parayba, the Rio Grande,
and Canabata, from whence they Avere driven out
by the Portuguese in 1600. In 1612, however,
they returned to construct a fortress in the island
of Maranon, Avith the name of San Luis, which,
was taken by the Dutch, and afterwards by the
Portuguese in 1646. From that time this king-
dom has belonged to the croAvn of Portugal, and
has given title to the heir apparent, who is called
Prince of Brazil. It has many fine rivers, and
many large, safe, and con\mnient ports ; but these
are difficult to be entered, on account of the rocks
and quicksands which abound on the coast. The
interior of this kingdom is uncultivated, full of
Avoods, mountains, and lakes ; inhabited by Avan-
dering nations, for the most part savage, and who
kept up a continual Avarfare Avith the Portuguese ;
sesue, howcAmr, have been civilized by the missions
that have been established among them by the
venerable Father Joseph de Ancheta, of the com-
pany of Jesuits, Avho has been called the Tuuma-
