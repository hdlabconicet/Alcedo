==[[Chiquinquira|CHIQUINQUIRA]]==, a settlement of the corregi-
miento of Tunja in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada.
It is of a cold temperature, but is healthy ; its
situation is delightful, and it abounds in produc-
tions. It is watered by a river which runs through
the centre of it, the waters of which are unwhole-
some : at a small distance another river passes
through a plain ; this is called Balsa, or Raft, since,
before the bridge was thrown across it, it was passed
by rafts. It rises from the lake Fuguene, and
abounds in most exquisite fish. The settlement,
which was formerly but small, is now of great note,
and its inhabitants are about 500, besides 70 In-
dians. It has a good convent of the religious order
of S. Domingo, and is noted for the sanctuary of
the virgin of its title. Under the large altar, at
which is placed this image, there is a small foun-
tain of water, renowned for the curing of infirmities,
as is also the earth which is extracted from thence;
it being by no means the least part of the prodigy,
that although this earth has been constantly taken
out for upwards of 200 years, the excavation formed
thereby is comparatively exceedingly small. The
faith in, and devotion towards this image, are
throughout the kingdom very great, and not lesa
so with regard to strangers, who visit it in great
numbers from far distant provinces. This settle-
ment is nine leagues from Tunja, and 15 to the
