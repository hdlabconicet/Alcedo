==[[Colleton|COLLETON]]==, a county of the province of [[Ca]]-

Grenville, and watered by the river Stone, which
unites itself with an arm of the Wadrnoolan. That
part which looks to the n, e. is peopled with es-
tablishments of Indians, and forms, with the other
part, an island called Buono, which is a little below
Charlestown, and is well cultivated and in-
habited. The principal rivers of this country are,
the Idistows, the S. and N. Two or three miles up
the former river, the shores are covered with plan-
tations, which continue for more than three miles
further n. where the river meets with the N. Edis-
tow, and in the island formed by both of them,
it is reckoned that 20 freeholders reside. These
are thus called, from the nature of the assignment
and distribution of lands which took place in the
new colonies. But the English governor did not
grant an absolute and perpetual property, save to
particular individuals : the concession was some-
times for life, sometimes considered as lineal,
sometimes to descend to the wife, children, or re-
lations, and sometimes with greater restrictions.
The above-mentioned people have, however, their
vote in the assembly, and send to it two members.

church.
