[==[[Concfiattas|CONCFIATTAS]]==, Indians of N. America, al-
most the same people as the Allibamis. They
first lived on Bayau Chico, in Appelousa district ;
but, four years ago, moved to the river Sabine,
settled themselves on the e. bank, where they now
live, in nearly a s. direction from Natchitoch, and
distant about 80 miles. They call their number
of men about 160 ; but say, if they were altogether,
they would amount to 200. Several families of
them live in detached settlements. They are good
hunters. Game is here in plenty. They kill an
uncommon number of bears. One man alone,
during the summer and fall hunting, sometimes
kills 400 deer, and sells his skins at 40 dollars per
100. The bears usually yield from eight to 12
gallons of oil, each of which never sells for less
than a dollar a gallon, and the skin a dollar more.
No great quantity of the meat is saved. What
the hunters do not use when out, they generally
give to their dogs. The Conchattas are friendly
with all other Indians, and speak well of their
neighbours the Carankouas, who, they say, live
about 80 miles s. of them, on the bay, which is
the nearest point to the sea from Natchitoches.
A tew families of Chactaws have lately settled near
them from Bayau Bceiif. The Conchattas speak
Creek, which is their native language, and Chac-
taw, and several of them English ; and one or two
of tliem can read it a little.]
