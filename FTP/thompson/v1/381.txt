fast for a long time together : they consequently
cat frequently ; the common food on these occa-

Guatemala. Lat. 17'^ 4'. Long. 93° 53'.

==[[Ciii Apa|CiiiAPA]]==, another city in the same province,
which, to distinguish it from the former, is called
Cliiapa de los Indios; these (the Indians) being,
for the most part, its inhabitants ; is the largest
settlement in the whole province, and is situate in
a valley close upon the river Tabasco, being 12
leagues distant from the former city. It has va-
rious churches, abounds in wealth, and is the place
wherein the Indian families first settled. They
enjoy many privileges and exemptions, owing to
the zeal of the bishop, J^rtr/y Bartolorae de las Ca-
sas, their procurator at court. The river abounds
greatly in fine fish ; and is full of barks, with
which the}" occasionally represent sea-fights. In
the city also there are commonly balls, plays, con-
certs, bull-fights, and spectacles of horsemanship ;
since the inhabitants are much given to diversions,
and in these grudge no expence.
