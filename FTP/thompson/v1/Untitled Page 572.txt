lake is as cold as snow itself. This province, like
all (he others of the kingdom which lie to the s. e.

of thunder and lightning, accompanied with bois-

darker complexion than those of any other ; but
they are also of loftier stature, better made, agile,
and extremely addicted to the chase, in which
they greatly excel, and more particularly in the
taking of ostriches, which abound in the llanuras
to the s. ; and by all of these exercises they become
so light and active as to be able to keep pace with
a horse. These Indians are generally known here
by the name of Guapes, and are descendants of
the Pampas, their neighbours to tlie e. with whom
they trade in the fruits of the country in exchange
fo? clothes and other articles, money not being
known amongst any of these barbarians. The
Guapes are of a docile and generous disposition,
but of great spirit, and very warlike, robust, and
well formed. This country, considering its ex-
tent, is but thinly peopled, since its inhabitants
amount to only 25,000 of all sexes and ages, ac-
cording to the latest calculation. The capital is
the city of Mendoza. [See Chile.]
