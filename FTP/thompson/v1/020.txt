Catholic faith by father Andres de Rivas, a Jesuit.
Their country consists of some extensive and fer-
tile plains, and they are by nature superior to the
other Indians of [[Nueva España]]]. Moreover, their
Heathenish customs do not partake so much of the
spirit of barbarism. They abhorred polygamy,
and held virginity in the highest estimation : and
thus, by way of distinction, unmarried girls wore

a small shell suspended to their neck, until the day
of their nuptials, when it was taken off by the bride-
groom. Their clothes were decent, composed of
wove cotton, and'they had a custom of bewailing
their dead for a whole year, night and morning,
with an apparently excessive grief. They are
gentle and faithful towards the Spaniards, with
whom they have continued in peace and unity
from the time of their first subjection. The prin-
cipal settlement is of the same name, and lies at
the mouth of the river Fuerte, on the coast of the
