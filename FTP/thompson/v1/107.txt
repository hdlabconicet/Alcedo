They are thus called because they are Charibbes,

rous custom of eating their fellow-creatures. [The
district they live in is called after them. Their
village is about 25 miles to the westward of the
Attakapa church, towards Quelqueshoe. Their
number of men is about 50 ; but some Tunicas and
Humas, who have married in their nation, and
live with them, make them altogether about 80.
